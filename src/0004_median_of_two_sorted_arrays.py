PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively. Find the median of the two sorted
arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.


EXAMPLE 1

- Input: nums1 = [1, 3], nums2 = [2]
- Output: 2.0


EXAMPLE 2

- Input: nums1 = [1, 2], nums2 = [3, 4]
- Output: 2.5
